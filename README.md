# FileInputOutput
Write a single code file named file_input_output.py in Python that concatenates the following two strings and stores them in a variable named output_string:

“Python has been an important part of Google since the beginning, and remains so as the system grows and evolves.”

“Today dozens of Google engineers use Python, and we're looking for more people with skills in this language." said Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, Inc.”

Your application then needs to write the contents of the variable (output_string) to a file called “Python.txt”.
Create a second variable named input_string and read the contents of the text file in and print out the contents of input_string.

Also create and submit pseudo code of your application in a file called pseudo_file_input_output.txt
